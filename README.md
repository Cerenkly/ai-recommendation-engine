# AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

This project builds a machine-learning recommendation system using Python and scikit-learn.
It trains on real-world datasets and serves predictions through a REST API for use in web applications.

The goal is to explore how ML models can be used to personalize recommendations and improve
user engagement in data-driven products.
